# C Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of C language projects! Each project here demonstrates practical use of C programming concepts like file handling, control structures, functions, loops, and more. Perfect for students and learners looking to build real-world logic in C.

## üìÇ Projects Included

### 1. Bank Management System
- A file-based banking app that allows:
  - Account creation
  - Deposit & Withdrawal
  - Account search, view, modify, and delete
- Concepts used: `struct`, file I/O, functions, string handling, conditionals, and loops.
- Files:
  - `bank_management_system.c`
  - `bank_management_system.exe`
  - `accounts.txt` (data file)

### 2. Number Guessing Game
- A console game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.
- Concepts used: loops, conditionals, random number generation.
- Files:
  - `number_guessing_game.c`
  - `number_guessing_game.exe`

### 3. Snake Water Gun Game
- A simple CLI version of the traditional Snake-Water-Gun game.
- Concepts used: conditionals, random numbers, basic game logic.
- Files:
  - `snake_water_gun_game.c`
  - `snake_water_gun_game.exe`

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile & Run
1. Use any C compiler (like GCC).
2. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc bank_management_system.c -o bank_management_system
   ./bank_management_system
